### Project Outline

This project focuses on enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of buttons using CSS animations and transitions. It features three distinct button styles with different animations and effects.

### Design Choices

1. **General Styling**:

2. **Button Styles and Animations**:
   - **Button 1**: A circular button with a bouncing animation (`@keyframes bounce`). The hover effect changes the size, background color, and applies a box shadow. This button's animation and visual effects are particularly engaging and demonstrate advanced CSS skills.
   - **Button 2**: A rectangular button with a slide-in animation (`@keyframes slideIn`). The hover effect alters the background color, border, and applies a box shadow. The click effect changes the background color to a dark blue (`#003f7f`).
   - **Button 3**: A circular button with a pulsing animation (`@keyframes pulse`). The hover effect changes the background to transparent, applies a box shadow, and initiates a pulsing animation. The click effect turns the button black (`#000000`).

### Notable Features and Challenges

- **Proud Features**:
  - The bounce animation for Button 1 adds a playful, dynamic element.
  - The pulse animation for Button 3, along with its hover and click effects, creates an engaging user experience.

- **Challenges**:
  - Balancing the animations and transitions to ensure they are smooth and not overwhelming.

This project demonstrates a range of CSS techniques to create interactive and visually appealing button animations.
